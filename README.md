# backend-gitlab_ci-kubernetes


Here's a brief explanation of what each part of the .gitlab-ci.yml file does:


    - stages: defines the stages of the pipeline.

    - variables: defines some environment variables that will be used in the pipeline. 
    IMAGE_TAG specifies the tag to use for the container image (in this case, latest). 
    DOCKER_REGISTRY specifies the registry to push the container image to (in this case, registry.example.com).
    
    - build: builds the services.
    
    - test: runs the tests for the services.
    
    - build_image: builds the Docker container image using the Dockerfile in the repository root directory and tags it with the registry and image name.
    
    - push_image: logs in to the Docker registry using environment variables $DOCKER_USERNAME and $DOCKER_PASSWORD, then pushes the built Docker image to the registry with the specified tag.
    
    - deploy: uses the kubectl command-line tool to apply the Kubernetes manifest file (your-kubernetes-manifest.yaml) to the target Kubernetes cluster.


Note that the pipeline assumes you have already set up a Docker registry and a Kubernetes cluster. You will also need to define the DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_PASSWORD environment variables in your GitLab project's CI/CD settings.
